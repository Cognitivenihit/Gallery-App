# Gallery-App
 The Gallery App is a responsive web-based application that showcases a beautiful collection of images in a visually appealing gallery layout. Each image in the gallery represents a theme (e.g., cute animals, serene landscapes) and is linked to an external collection of similar images hosted online. When a user clicks on a specific image tile, they are redirected to a curated collection related to that image.  This project demonstrates how to create a simple, professional, and functional image gallery using HTML and CSS with clean design principles and modern web practices.
